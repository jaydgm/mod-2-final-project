Fortnite POI GUide

Core functionality:
- Be able to display all of the POIs of the current Fortnite seasons map, with each POI being a clickable button
that, when clicked, displays information on that respective POI. 
- Use cases: 
	- a new user who is unfamiliar with the map wants to know where is a good place to land that doesn't have 
		too much traffic, so as to avoid dying early game. they can find the POI's that are low in popularity
		by checking the POIs info through the clicking of each POI.
	- a user who has been playing for some time forgets where to get a particular Mythic Weapon. this information
		can be found by clicking the POI's with medallions.
- a combination of OOP and functional programming will be implemented.
- Bootstrap for modals and navbar will be implemented
